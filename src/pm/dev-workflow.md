# Riveto Application Development Workflow

Our platform is Github. Currently (Jan 2025) we have 2 repos: **1.riveto-front** and **2.riveto-back**. When working on any services of the projects, this flow in Github will be followed:

1. **One branch for Each issue**\
 check the issue that is assigned to you and create a branch on the appropriate previous branch. Reference the related issue in the Branch Name (e.g., - issue #number).
2. **Make Pull Requests (PRs)**\
Open a PR for each branch.
Reference the related issue in the PR description (e.g., - issue #number).
3. **Review**\
Someone will be assigned to the project to Review.
4. **Testing**\
before the merge, tests are run and the integration between the frontend and backend will be tested.
5. **Release**\
After Testing and approval, the branch will be merged into the main branch.

> This procedure is forced as a regulatory instruction in Riveto.
